## The Hider Bot

Hider starts a meter away from seeker and begins it's quest to find a good hiding place immediately after running the program. First, to make sure the hider did not find the same hiding place every time, the hider turns in one of four directions, which is selected randomly. It spins until it reaches the designated yaw, then goes forward, now searching for a hiding place. The algorithm is now a wall following one, but there are a few more conditions for the hider. First, it uses LIDAR readings to measure proximity in five different regions. Using the front, right, and left scan regions, it determines whether it is in a tight place (on this map, a corner). Once it gets within very close range (under one meter in the front and less than half a meter in right or left), the algorithm moves to the second check, odometry. With it's initial position next to the seeker measured against it's current distance from that point, the hider can tell how far away it is from it's start -- more importantly -- the seeker. Once the hider is over 4 meters away in both x and y directions indicating a likelihood that the hider is out of sight range of the seeker, it is able to hide. In the hide state, all turns are stopped, linear spped is decreased to 0.1 to drive it all the way into the corner, and the program ends.
