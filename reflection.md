## How the project unfolded and how we worked together as a team

Even though we were assigned randomly, we couldn't have functioned better as a team. Since the beginning, we brainstormed together and were able to quickly come up with ideas and algorithms for our project. There were many obstacles along the way but whenever these came up we would take the time to meet and come up with a solution. We only had a little over a month but we made achievable goals and aimed to accomplish a small task every week. This helped us stay on schedule and see all of our ambitions realized. We are an effective team and can't wait to work with each other again in the future. :)
