### Custom World

For our project, we decided to leard more about sdf and world files so that we could create a custom gazebo world that would best fit our goal. On gazebo, we made a model of a maze like room with rooms in four corners. We also added colors for the aesthetic of our program. We thought it would be helpful to make the world first and then start on our algorithm so that we could brainstorm effectivley.
